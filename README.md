# PrimeHunter
Coding test project for New Relic

Write a program to calculate the highest possible prime number in 60 seconds.

**DESCRIPTION:**
**A prime number is an integer which is divisible by only 2 factors, itself and 1.  For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 are prime numbers, but 1, 4, 6, 8, 9 are not prime.**

Write a program which runs for exactly 60 seconds and calculates the highest prime number value possible in that amount of time.  Your program should display the timer progress as well as the highest numbers calculated along the way.  On completion it must display the max prime number that was calculated.

Write this program in any language you choose.  Spend up to 4 hours to prepare & code your solution.  Commit the final solution plus any necessary documentation to github or any other distributed, online code repository system (if possible, we would like to see at least 3 separate pushes to the repository).  We are interested in what your design and coding process is as much as the actual program code itself.

When you are done, please share the following with us:

1. The github repository URL for your code
2. The maximum prime # you generated in the 60 seconds
